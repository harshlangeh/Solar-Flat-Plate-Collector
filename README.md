The virtual test rig (VTR) for a solar thermal device (for eg. - FPC) should contain two parts. Part A- Solar Calculator (Assignment already completed) and Part B  - Testing part. You must integrate both parts to form a VTR that can test the ST device under different design and operational conditions. Prediction of the performance parameters of the device at different conditions should be the outcome of the test rig.


The assignment will be evaluated on the following points:
1. Originality = make yourself
2. Understanding of concepts and working (report and presentation) = docs file
5. Flexibility/Scalability of the VTR  = Graphical user interface
